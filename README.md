# examples
Python demos and utilities, mostly for machine learning and image formatting. 

### preprocessing.py

Of particular interest is the preprocessing.py program, which takes images of arbitrary size, rebalances the colors, 
resizes them, and saves them in a variety of image formats. For a full list of options, use the `python preprocessing.py -h` 
command. Partially adapted from user Gauss256's kernel for the Kaggle Docs vs. Cats Redux Kaggle challenge, available 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/gauss256/preprocess-images).

### central_limit.py

central_limit.py is a demonstration of the central limit theorem, computing means from arbitrary distributions and plotting
the output as a histogram, which should approach a normal distribution.

### name_generator.py

name_generator.py generates names and numbers in a variety of formats, for use in a variety of programs, like the grading
example from Koenig's Accelerated C++ Chapter 9.
